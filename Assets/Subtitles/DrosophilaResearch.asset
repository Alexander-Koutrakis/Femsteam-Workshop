  Texts:
  - Our experiments aimed to identify genes involved in the development
  - of Drosophila melanogaster embryos.
  - the fruit fly embryos develop extremely rapidly, which makes them perfect for
    research.
  - Wieschaus and I have identified and classified 15 genes that instruct cells to
    begin forming the fly
  - developing a detailed understanding of how an embryo's shape is determined by
    genes
  - That understanding had major implications for human reproduction, as well
